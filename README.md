Convergence of Several Fixed Geometry Nozzles Using the
Pseudo-1D Euler Equations

Abstract

The pseudo-1D Euler equations will be used to simulate several different converging-diverging nozzle geome-
tries and test each nozzlesâ€™ ability to converge to a steady state with a shock in the diverging section of the
nozzle. Each simulation will use a fixed pressure ratio starting from a pressure reservoir and exhausting to
the ambient environment. The location of the shock from simulations will be compared to the analytical
quasi-1D solution derived from isentropic and shock relations in the nozzle. In addition to tracking the
shock location, the flow property distribution will also be analyzed to ensure the expected physics of flow in
a converging-diverging nozzle is satisfied.
