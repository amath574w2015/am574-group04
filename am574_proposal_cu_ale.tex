\maketitle

We propose to simulate nozzle flows in 1-D and 2-D for subsonic and supersonic applications by solving the Euler equations. We will choose a nozzle curvature which will be kept consistent for all simulations and test the ability of different finite volume methods, using wave-propagation methods, in tracking the shock location relative to the theoretical, quasi 1-D nozzle solution. We will also test each method's ability for shock capturing and implement in the correct boundary conditions by tracing the characteristics for subsonic and supersonic applications.

The 1-D case will be tested first using wave-propagation methods. The proper boundary conditions will also need to be implemented by tracing the characteristic waves in the correct direction.
